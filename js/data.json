Abbie was very sweet, funny, outgoing and a joy to be around.\n\nThat’s what makes this review so difficult. I’m really unhappy with my nails… I feel like I showed several examples of what I wanted shape-wise and color-wise and that’s just not what I got at all. I have social anxiety, so communicating when I don’t like something is really hard but this time I tried and just felt like I wasn’t heard. I’m not a nail professional, so when I ask for something I’m expecting the professional to let me know the best possible way we can achieve what I asked for so that it looks the best it can look. I’m very particular about my nails. I don’t feel like I received thoughtful service, and feel really disappointed overall. I don’t blame Abbie for this, I think some of that is on me and it was just a communication issue. \n\nThe worst part about all of this was the incredibly aggressive pedicure that I received. The male technician was VERY heavy handed… I asked him several times to be gentler and he just didn’t. He put a sea salt scrub on me, and didn’t focus on my feet - just my legs and he rubbed them so hard and so long that they burned and felt raw. When he did massage my feet, it was very short and he mostly focused on punching my heel. I’m not sure if that was supposed to loosen it up or what but it mainly just hurt. Then, he kept trying to upsell me and I kept saying I just want the most basic pedi service they offer. He even said he’d give me an upgrade for free if I “give him a shout out on Instagram,” which I also declined. The paint job is really inconsistent too… he kept pushing and pulling my legs and moving me around like a doll rather than speaking to me. I felt extremely uncomfortable the entire time and couldn’t wait for it to be over. It was the opposite of relaxing. \n\nAbbie is great and very knowledgeable and the nails she puts on her Instagram are all so beautiful. I think this salon is great too, but I’m so particular that maybe it’s just not the right salon for me personally.",

This last time she had to replace a NEW nail and I mentioned to her the nail was lifting and the fact that this was a new nail, I should not be charged for it. She proceeds to send a long text message that again states she uses the best products on the market. And also she decides to say I need to find another nail tech. Now ask yourself is this the kind of relationship you want with a nail tech? If your answer is no, DO NOT BOOK WITH HER! She does not care about client needs only about her image and awards she has won. I highly recommend Kendra Letcher as a nail tech. Book with her stat and you won’t be disappointed.",

Just friendly reminder  that I always willing to fix nails for my clients in my spare time without any fee. It's the first time I have a client texted me 9 hours before her fill-in apt said that I needed to give her discount for her lifting nails in her fill-in service.\nWhile it's important to determine the root cause of the lifting nails, my willingness to accommodate my clients' desires. Charging based on time rather than per finger is a fair approach.\nDue to unforseen circumstances that are out of my control, I am unable to serve without change any of my factor: products and skills and they are the best on the market already. I think it’s the best for you to find someone who can accomplish your desire not lifting concern to your desire time. I apologize if there was any confusion in my previous response. I am unable to change my products and skills to address the lifting issue. It's important to set realistic expectations, and if I believe that another nail professional may be better suited to achieve the desired results without lifting problems, it might be a good idea for the client to explore other options."
